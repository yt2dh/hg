  <p><b>Summary of Instructions</b></p>

  <p><u>Roles and Groups</u></p>

  <ul>
    <li>At the beginning of each match, you will be randomly assigned one of the three roles: square (□), circle (○), or triangle (△), with equal probability. This means that your role may differ in every match. Each role will select one of two options in each match.
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li> In each match, one square (□), one circle (○), and one triangle (△) will form a group. The points you earn depend on your own decision and the decisions of your group members. At the beginning of each match, you will be randomly paired with two other participants. This means that your group members may differ from those in previous matches.
  </ul>

  <p><u>Highlighting Tool</u></p>
  <ul>
    <li>To help you make your decision, you can highlight or unhighlight any arrow of the flow chart by simply clicking on it.
  </ul>

  <p><u>End of the experiment</u></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The computer will randomly select 10 of 60 matches to determine your earnings. Your final earnings will be displayed on the screen at the end of the experiment.
  </ul>
